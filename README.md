    This whole JavaScript guide is inspired by BroCode
    You can check out his YouTube channel @: https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez

    You can use this guide as a template if you want to watch BroCode's full course and "code along"
    You can check out his full course of JavaScript for FREE @: https://youtu.be/8dWL3wF_OMw
        - All of the folders you can see here are from that full course 
        and I just modified some of the codes and added comments for reminders



    Note: I created this for beginners and also a note for myself 
    incase I forgot some JavaScript codes and its purposes.

    Feel free to add, update, change or modify something that 
    will make this guide much better! will be much appreciated.

    ======================================================================

    Starting from topic/folder 70, comments will be decreased.
    Codes are getting more complicated so in order to reduce that, 
    I'll start by minimizing the comments I'll put.
